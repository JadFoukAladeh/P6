  <!-- This will be the unordered list (point form) of everything accomplished during week 1-->
  <ul> <!-- Recall the <ul> tag stands for unordered list, which will create a list using point form-->

    <li> Installed VScode on ubuntu virtual machine</li>
    <li> Installed VScode required extensions </li>
    <li> Installed XAMPP on ubuntu virtual machine. XAMPP was set to startup on boot</li>
    <li> Installed STM32 cube IDE to program STM32F303RE for Project VI </li>
    <li> Setup a local server that can be reached through localhost (on virtual machine) or IP address (when on same wifi network as host): 192.168.2.55. 
         The local server can be found in /var/www/html directory on the virtual machine. This is the default XAMPP deployment folder
    </li>
    <li> Setup github connection with partner and was able to create a branch and merge with the main thread</li>
    <li> Obtained contact information for partner and setup communication through discord server</li>
    <li> Reviewed the wiring diagram for the elevator </li>
  </ul>

      <li> met with partner to discuss project in first project meeting</li>
      <li> planned added feature for project</li>
      <li> started rough 3D design of elevator door module</li>
      <li> started flow chart for new code for elevator door modules and controls</li>
      <li> discussed and agreed upon project plan with partner</li>
      <li> modified project server to allow for both logbooks to be accessable on server in seperate links</li>
      <li> started planning for braile buttons for the elevator controls</li>
      <li> planned rough layout for the GUI for the elevator control scheme</li>
      <li> completed weekly status report with partner</li>
      <li> consulted with partner on testing plan and our ideas towards what needed to be tested</li>
      <li> connected over to team project website hosted on the Rpi and verified that it worked</li>
      <li> performed seventh commit to the project which added features including individual logbook pages and an added submenu</li>
      <li>pushed seventh commit to the repository</li>
      <li>created project plan page and basic project plan template. still have not populated it</li>

    <h2 id="week3"> Week 3 </h2>

    <ul>
      <li>completed phase 1 of the Hal hand out on setting up the GPIO</li>
      <li>met with partner and disscussed Debriefing 1 and made plans for how to improve</li>
      <li>discussed plans for the button panel and decided that the physical button panel was something Jad would be handling himself </li>
      <li>worked on implementing phase 2 of the gpio set up</li>
      <li>worked on setting up css in class following demo</li>
      <li>tested CAN GPIO stage 1 code and got it working</li>
      <li>issue with the stage 1 code ended up being forgetting to hit resume after entering the debugger</li>
      <li>begun working on stage 2 of the CAN GPIO code</li>
      <li>pushed stage 1 code to the github</li>
      <li></li>
      <li>plan for next week is to work on the next stage of the code and set up the filters</li>
      <li>also plan to implement code to call the elevator to each floor during the next week</li>

    </ul>

    <h2 id="week4"> Week 4</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>met with Jad on monday to discuss plans for project for this week</li>
      <li>modified demo code to feature the external buttons and the different floors</li>
      <li>got code to compile with the added features and tried to upload it to the nucleos on Tuesday</li>
      <li>was able to upload the code to the top nucleo and the bottom 2 but the second from the top wouldn't connect to my computer</li>
      <li>noticed the nucleo looked damaged so met with Dave and Jad on Wednesday to replace it.</li>
      <li>week was not very productive on project as I am in the middle of a family emergancy</li>
      <li>discovered I had not changed the ID from the supervisory controller ID and I made the change to correspond with the proper ID values for each floor node</li>
      <li>Friday morning I learned that the RPi was giving a bunch of can errors. Dave was working on the elevator after that and at time of writing I am not sure what is wrong with the elevator</li>
      <li>if possible going to try and upload the new code to the nucleos and test it using the blue buttons to see if the RPi keeps giving the error. another option would be to have a group with working code upload their code and see what happens</li>
      <li>I have not heard from Jad since Wednesday and I am not sure what he has done and if any of it caused the issue</li>
      <li>uploaded new code to elevator nucleos. currently only using blue button on each elevator.</li>
      <li>went through arduino code to understand what was going on a bit more</li>
      <li>realized issue with elevator was just the code not being correct for the nucleos</li>
      <li>discussed with Jad all the work he did to the website</li>
      <li>tested elevator to make sure the correct value was being displayed on the LCD</li>
      <li>discussed the plans for the push buttons going forward.</li>
      <li>going to continue to try and reflash the code for floor 3 to the third floor nucleo. as currently floor 3 goes to floor 2 and floor 2 goes to floor 3</li>


    </ul>
    <hr/>
  <h2 id="week5"> Week 5</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>tested external buttons for each floor using the blue shield for the nucleo</li>
    <li>discovered I had the buttons wrong, first I had the second floor and third floors reversed so I fixed that in the code.</li>
    <li>also fixed the leds so they were all for the correct floors</li>
    <li>discovered that the response time was not consistant for the buttons and sometimes the buttons take a while to respond</li>
    <li>pushed updated nucleo code to the git so that it is </li>
    <li>holding the buttons on the blue shield works better than just pressing them</li>
    <li>helped record demo video of the elevator working with the external buttons</li>
    <li>met with Jad to discuss all changes done to the project</li>
  </ul>
