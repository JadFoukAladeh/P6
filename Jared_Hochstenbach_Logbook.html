    <h2 id="week4"> Week 4</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>met with Jad on monday to discuss plans for project for this week</li>
      <li>modified demo code to feature the external buttons and the different floors</li>
      <li>got code to compile with the added features and tried to upload it to the nucleos on Tuesday</li>
      <li>was able to upload the code to the top nucleo and the bottom 2 but the second from the top wouldn't connect to my computer</li>
      <li>noticed the nucleo looked damaged so met with Dave and Jad on Wednesday to replace it.</li>
      <li>week was not very productive on project as I am in the middle of a family emergancy</li>
      <li>discovered I had not changed the ID from the supervisory controller ID and I made the change to correspond with the proper ID values for each floor node</li>
      <li>Friday morning I learned that the RPi was giving a bunch of can errors. Dave was working on the elevator after that and at time of writing I am not sure what is wrong with the elevator</li>
      <li>if possible going to try and upload the new code to the nucleos and test it using the blue buttons to see if the RPi keeps giving the error. another option would be to have a group with working code upload their code and see what happens</li>
      <li>I have not heard from Jad since Wednesday and I am not sure what he has done and if any of it caused the issue</li>
      <li>uploaded new code to elevator nucleos. currently only using blue button on each elevator.</li>
      <li>went through arduino code to understand what was going on a bit more</li>
      <li>realized issue with elevator was just the code not being correct for the nucleos</li>
      <li>discussed with Jad all the work he did to the website</li>
      <li>tested elevator to make sure the correct value was being displayed on the LCD</li>
      <li>discussed the plans for the push buttons going forward.</li>
      <li>going to continue to try and reflash the code for floor 3 to the third floor nucleo. as currently floor 3 goes to floor 2 and floor 2 goes to floor 3</li>


    </ul>
    <hr/>
  <h2 id="week5"> Week 5</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>tested external buttons for each floor using the blue shield for the nucleo</li>
    <li>discovered I had the buttons wrong, first I had the second floor and third floors reversed so I fixed that in the code.</li>
    <li>also fixed the leds so they were all for the correct floors</li>
    <li>discovered that the response time was not consistant for the buttons and sometimes the buttons take a while to respond</li>
    <li>pushed updated nucleo code to the git so that it is </li>
    <li>holding the buttons on the blue shield works better than just pressing them</li>
    <li>helped record demo video of the elevator working with the external buttons</li>
    <li>met with Jad to discuss all changes done to the project</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="week6"> Week 6</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>begun work on developing 3D assembly for door module</li>
    <li>determined we would use a 2 segment door which would reduce the size of the overall unit when the door is open.</li>
    <li>the inner of the 2 segments of the door will be connected to a lead screw which will move it along the door frame.</li>
    <li>the outer segment will be pulled by a set of tongues on the back of the inner module, this will allow it to only be moved when the inner module pushes against it</li>
    <li>at the moment the plan is to use a pair of limit switches to detect when the door is in the closed or open position.</li>
    <li>when the door open limit switch is pressed, an interrupt will be triggered that will start a countdown, if a button is pressed then the door may close sooner, bt otherwise the door will remain open until the countdown is complete and after that the door will close and wait for another input</li>
    <li>while the door is open floor requests will be stored in a queue or database waiting for the door to close for them to be processed</li>
    <li>if one of the floor request buttons is pressed, the countdown will advance to 5 seconds and then the door will close allowing the elevator to go to that floor</li>
    <li>will either use the RPi or the arduino to control the door motor</li>
    <li>met with Jad to discuss all changes done to the project</li>

  </ul>
  <h2 id="week7"> Week 7</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>on tuesday I met with Jad to discuss the progress on the project. he had fixed the 2 broken buttons on the 2 blue boards but now we were having an issue where nothing was working</li>
    <li>I looked at the CAN bus and found that the DB9 port for the arduino had broke and was not actually connected to the board. </li>
    <li>Jad worked on replacing it and on friday when we got to work on it I found that one of the wires connected to the arduino was disconnected. I plugged it back in based on the wires from the next elevator</li>
    <li>Worked more on design file for the door. added a frame and adjusted the tolerances so that the door will not get stuck but will also not rattle around</li>
    <li>did not get as much done this week as I hoped because we had 2 midterms to study for</li>
    <li>I am planning on continuing to work on project over reading week</li>
    <li>over reading week I am planning on working on the wiring for the door module to enable it to work properly
      
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="week9"> Week 9</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>continued working on design for the opening elevator doors</li>
    <li>decided to use the lead screw and Z axis components from an Ender 3 3D printer as the motor and controls for the opening and closing of the doors</li>
    <li>I was going to use the limit switches and stepper motor circuitry from project 4 but because of how the floor nodes are set up I am going to need to set up a seperate limit switch circuit mounted on a bread board as a solution</li>
    <li>I also plan on repurposing code used in project 4 and modifying it so that the door is controlled by the floor update signal sent to the car controller node.</li>
    <li>did not get as much done this week as I hoped because we had 2 midterms to study for</li>
    <li>the reason I need a new limit switch circuit is because PC5 is in use with the lights on the blue board, and it was also the pin used in the past for the limit switch. as such I am going to rebuild the circuit for it using spare parts and connect it to PC7</li>
    <li>one of my ideas was to mount the limit switch under the door so that as the door closes it would close the switch. I decided against this as it would be easier to just mount them at the ends of travel as wiring and operation will be simpler</li>
    <li>the last part of the design of the housing is including a mounting point for the motor, and working on the weight distribution as it is very front heavy</li>
